Kick it!
You wake up late for school, man you don't want to go
You ask you sister, please? but she still says, no!
You missed two classes, and no homework
But your teacher preaches class like you're some kind of jerk
You gotta right for your fight to party
Your pop caught you smoking, and he said, no way!
That hypocrite smokes two packs a day
Man, living at home is such a drag
Now your mom threw away your best porno mag (bust it!)
You gotta right for your fight to party
You gotta right
Don't step out of this house if that's the clothes you're gonna wear
I'll kick you out of my home is you don't cut that hair
Your mom busted in and said, what's that noise?
Aw, mom you're just jealous it's the Beastie Boys!
You gotta right for your fight to party
You gotta right for your fight to party
Party
Party
